# OldRec Launcher - Locally hosted server software to use older builds of Rec Room

## About
OldRec is a locally hosted server for older versions of Rec Room ranging from 2016 to 2020, containing many extra features alongside being able to emulate Rec Room's old servers.

As of right now, OldRec Launcher is not open-source and isn't planned to be, the files you see in the repo are files the server will download and use as it runs.
## How do I use this server/that feature?
